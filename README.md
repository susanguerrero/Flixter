### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in our labs prepared me to complete the assignment, more specifically the basic JavaScript functions which were what I felt like I used the most. I felt unprepared when writing my CSS code with the layout of the page.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

When I have more time, I plan on completing the search tool as well as add stretched features, more specifically improving the UI and the accessibility for all users.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Completing this project was extremely fast paced and exciting. This was my first exposure to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which became overwhelming at times but ultimately, fun. For next time, I hope to have more time and apply the skills I've learned this past week to produce a better website.

### Shout out

I want to give a shout out to Tirumari, Matt, Nicholas, and Diego as well as the rest of my peers for the amazing support.
